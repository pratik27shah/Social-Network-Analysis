THIS PROJECT IS ON FACEBOOK DATA

Steps to install Facepy:
Go to terminal/cmd in the anaconda scripts and type the below command
pip install facepy

Do Not delete configure.txt as it contains user tokens and keys

Summary of Project:
Collect.py

In this file the data is collected use FaceBook API called Facepy the comments for the Page of Donald Trump are got by
passing the page ID to the API calls.To create a graph for clusters here we see for pages that are liked by the official page of 
Donald Trump and the pages those pages they like.For this HOP algorithms are used where every node are found and a edge is created between them
For FB comments the comments are read from Today(current date) to a specific previous date given in unxi format.Here we have collected 
Data from previous 10 months and stored the data using dataframe in a csv file called Trump.csv

Classify.py
Training Dataset
The training dataset is creating using various FB pages like.Hate Trump and other pages and even comments from pages like INDIA today about
Trump and his statements were used.To decide if data is positive or negative nltk library was used,The text was divided into tokens and emojis were
removed using the ascii value and classify them in folders depending on the sentiments as positive and negative
All values above 0.4 are taken in positive and and all text having values less then -0.4 are negative

Testing Data
Testing Data consist of data collected in collect.py the data is tokenized as done in the a2.py and the top 5
positive and negative comments said by trump are shown.Here negative comments include any harsh statement
The positive and negative statement are stored in the file and are read from the file.

Cluster Data
Here the cluster are formed using girvan newman algorithm.The clusters having values 1 are ignored and the each clusters 
can have a max size of 100 nodes at one time.The data is written to a file called clusters.txt and the graphs are plotted 
of the respective clusters of size>10.As we ignore do not include single nodes in cluster the total items might be a little less.


Summarize.py
The output is read from the file classify.txt and cluster.txt and written to a file summary.txt 


Conclusion:
From the above experiments it can be noted that the Facebook API does not have a time limit problem of 15 mins like twitter.
It is always difficult to analyse based on the FB posts because at times the comments cannot videos/images
While creating dataset for training pos/negative at times there could be an instance where the  negative data exceeds the positive date
by a high limit eg:using data from pages like Hate Trump for classification
Testing Dataset:Positive:1066 and negative:1066
